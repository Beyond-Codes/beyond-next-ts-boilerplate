## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Do not forget to change/create the .env.local file on root directory.

You should add/change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PATH_PREFIX` variables.

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` variable is the url of your project, it's necessary for meta tags.
Example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://beyond.codes
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PATH_PREFIX` variable is the path of your project is runs on a subpath. For example, if your project is running on https://example.com/app you should change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PATH_PREFIX` variable to `/app`. If your project doesn't runs on a subpath, you can leave the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PATH_PREFIX` variable empty. So you want to use the project on a subpath, you should change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PATH_PREFIX` variable. Example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PATH_PREFIX=/app
```

with these variables, the project will run on https://example.com/app

Do not forget to remove unused languages & packages for size optimization.
